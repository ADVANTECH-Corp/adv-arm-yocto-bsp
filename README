i.MX Repo Manifest README

This repo is used to download manifests for i.MX BSP releases.

Specific instructions will reside in READMEs in each branch.

The branch will be based on the release type Linux or Android with release manifests in each branch tied to the base releases.

For example for i.MX Linux Yocto Project releases the branches will be imx_linux_<Yocto Project release> so imx_linux_sumo with
all manifests tied to releases on sumo in this branch.

Setup the build folder for a BSP release:
-----------------------------------------
Note: The remaining instructions are for setting up a BSP release only. For setting
up a demo, please see imx-manifest/README-<demo> for further instructions.

$: [MACHINE=<machine>] [DISTRO=fsl-imx-<backend>] source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b bld-<backend>

<machine> defaults to imx6qsabresd

<backend>   Graphics backend type
xwayland    Wayland with X11 support - default distro
wayland     Wayland
x11         X11  (not supported for mx8)

$: MACHINE=imx7ulpevk DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b bld-xwayland
