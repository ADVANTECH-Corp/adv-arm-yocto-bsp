Freescale's Community Yocto BSP
===============================

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed.

Install the `repo` utility: (only need to do this once):
--------------------------------------------------
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

Download the BSP Yocto Project Environment into your directory:
-------------------------------------------
$: mkdir fsl-arm-yocto-bsp
$: cd fsl-arm-yocto-bsp
$: repo init -u git://git.freescale.com/imx/fsl-arm-yocto-bsp.git -b imx-4.1.15-1.0.0_ga
$: repo sync

Note this downloads the latest releases and patches on top of the 4.1.15-1.0.0 ga release.

If the GA release was downloaded before just do repo sync to fetch latest updates.

See ChangeLog for description of patch releases and tags for each update.

To checkout the GA release without patches do the following:
$: cd sources/meta-fsl-bsp-release
$: git checkout imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

To checkout earlier releases checkout the tag associated with the release such as 4.1.15-1.1.0
$: git checkout imx_4.1.15_1.1.0_ga

or 4.1.15-1.1.1
$: git checkout imx_4.1.15_1.1.1

Setup for a particular graphical backend.
-----------------------------------------
The examples uses imx6qsabresd MACHINE but substitute with whatever you are using:

Setup for X11.
$: MACHINE=imx6qsabresd DISTRO=fsl-imx-x11 source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b bld-x11

Setup for Wayland.
$: MACHINE=imx6qsabresd DISTRO=fsl-imx-wayland source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b bld-wayland

Setup for Wayland and X11.
$: MACHINE=imx6qsabresd DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b bld-xwayland

Setup for Frame Buffer.
$: MACHINE=imx6qsabresd DISTRO=fsl-imx-fb source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b bld-fb

Note if the poky community distro is used then build breaks will happen with some components using
our meta-fsl-bsp-release layer.

Note DirectFB is not supported in 4.1.15 release.

Build an image:
---------------
bitbake <image recipe>

Some image recipes:
fsl-image-gui - full image with demos and tests used for testing with graphics, no QT.
fsl-image-qt5 - fsl-image-gui with QT 5.5.
