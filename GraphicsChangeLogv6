Key Features of the Vivante 6.x Driver Series

    - Full support for Khronos OpenGL ES 3.2 API. The new OpenGL ES 3.2 and OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.20 specifications bring AEP,
      plus additional functionality, into core OpenGL ES. Vivante OpenGL ES 3.2 implementation has passed Khronos OpenGL ES 3.2 Conformance Test.
      And Vivante GC7000XS* GPU core has been certified by Khronos as an OpenGL ES 3.2 compliant product.
    - Backward Compatible with 5.x and 4.x Drivers. Existing OpenGL ES 3.x/2.0 applications can run on these drivers without any changes.
